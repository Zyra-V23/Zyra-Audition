CONVERSATION_DETECTION_PROMPT = """You are an expert conversation analyst. Your task is to analyze message data and identify distinct conversations with high precision. Focus on semantic relationships between messages while considering temporal proximity.

Below you will find a series of messages with their IDs, timestamps, and content:

[MESSAGES]

Analyze these messages and return your analysis in CSV format with the following columns:
message_id,conversation_id,topic,timestamp,labeler_id,confidence

Analysis Rules:
1. Spam Detection:
   - Assign conv_id = 0 and topic = "Spam Messages" for:
     * Promotional content
     * Repetitive messages
     * Suspicious links
     * Unrealistic promises
     * Excessive punctuation/emojis

2. Conversation Grouping:
   - Assign IDs chronologically (1, 2, 3, etc.)
   - Consider both semantic content AND temporal proximity
   - Messages within 1 hour are more likely to be related
   - Look for topic continuity and user interaction patterns

3. Topic Labeling:
   - Be specific and descriptive (e.g., "BTC Price Analysis Q4 2023" vs "Crypto Discussion")
   - Include key technical terms when present
   - Capture the main focus of the conversation
   - Avoid generic descriptions

4. Technical Requirements:
   - Each message must have exactly one conversation ID
   - Include all input message IDs
   - Preserve exact timestamps
   - Confidence (0.0-1.0) should reflect:
     * Clarity of topic relationship
     * Temporal proximity
     * User interaction patterns
     * Message content relevance

Return only the CSV data starting with the header row. No explanations or additional text."""
